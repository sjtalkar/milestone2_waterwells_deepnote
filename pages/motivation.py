        Groundwater, which is found in aquifers below the surface of the earth, is one of our most important natural resources. 
        Groundwater provides drinking water for a large portion of California, nay, the nation's population. It also supplies 
        business and industries and is used extensively  for irrigation. California depends on groundwater for a major portion 
        of its annual water supply, particularly during times of drought. This reliance on groundwater has resulted in overdraft
        and unsustainable groundwater usage in many of Californiaâ€™s basins, particularly so in the San Joaquin River basin.

        California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) was passed in 2014 with the intention to address over pumping, halt chronic water-level declines and bring long-depleted aquifers into balance. Despite SGMA, a frenzy of well drilling has continued on large farms across the San Joaquin Valley, the state's largest and most lucrative agricultural zone. As a result, shallower wells supplying nearly a thousand family homes have gone dry in recent years.
        Frequently, perniciously drought-inflicted California, depends on groundwater for a major portion of its annual water supply, particularly for agricultural and domestic usage. This project seeks to aid policy makers and natural resource management agencies preemptively identify areas prone to overdraft and bring groundwater basins into balanced levels of pumping and recharge. 
        Focused on the San Joaquin Valley, the objectives are:

        > Supervised Learning: Predict the groundwater depth in feet below ground surface (GSE_GWE). This value portends shortage in a TownshipRange. Increase or decrease in GSE_GWE will then indicate if there will be more requests for well construction. This in turn will provide a quantitative metric for whether SGMA is functioning and areas to focus on for recharge.
        
        > Unsupervised Learning: cluster areas into sustainable and unsustainable areas. Detect groundwater depth anomalies within Township Ranges in the river basin.
        The data granularity is Township-Range (Public Land Survey System) for the geography and annual for the time.
