    "## Preparing the Dataset\n",
    "### The Train-Test Split\n",
    "To fit our dataset and objective, as well as LSTM neural networks architecture we perform the train test split as follows:\n",
    "* Training and Test sets will be split by Township-Ranges. I.e., some Township-Ranges will have all their 2014-2021 data points in the training set, some others will be in the test set.\n",
    "* The model will be trained based on the 2014-2020 data for all features - including the target feature - with the training target being the 2021 value of the target feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a method, unlike a simple time series forecasting where the target feature is forecasted only based on its past value, we allow past value of other features (in our case cultivated crops, precipitations, population density, number of wells drilled) to influence the future value of the target feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Train-Test Split](../doc/images/lstm-train-test-split.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not create a validation dataset as we use Keras internal cross-validation mechanism to shuffle the data points (i.e., the Township-Ranges) and keep some for the validation at each training epoch.\n",
    "### Data Imputation and Scaling\n",
    "Missing data imputation for a Township-Range is performed only using the existing data of that Township-Range (not the data of all Township-Ranges). For example:\n",
    "* a *fill forward* approach is used for many fields like crops, vegetation and soils. The percentage of land use per crop in 2014 in a Township-Range is imputed into the missing year 2015 for that particular Township-Range.\n",
    "* for fields like `PCT_OF_CAPACITY` (the capacity percentage of water reservoir), missing values in a Township-Range are filled using the min, mean, median or max values of that particular Township-Range. In this case the *fit* method of our custom impute pipeline does nothing. Not only the impute pipeline does not need to learn values from other Township-Ranges data points to impute missing values in a Township-Range, if it does it will not be able to impute data in the test set as we impute by Township-Range and the Township-Ranges in the test set are not seen when *fitting* the impute pipeline. The *transform* method, then simply fills the missing values in a Township-Range based on past values of that Township range. This way, we can split the train and test sets by Township-Range and impute missing value without any data leakage as the impute pipeline does not learn anything from the Township-Ranges in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a MinMax scaler to scale all values between 0 and 1 for the neural network, except for the vegetation, soils and crops datasets which are already scaled between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that we do not need to do any data imputation on the training and test sets *y* target feature since it does not have any missing data point."

This architecture was inspired by the Encoder-Decoder architecture in this article: *[CNN-LSTM-Based Models for Multiple Parallel Input and Multi-Step Forecast](https://towardsdatascience.com/cnn-lstm-based-models-for-multiple-parallel-input-and-multi-step-forecast-6fe2172f7668)*.\n",
