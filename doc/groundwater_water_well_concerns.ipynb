The collapsing ground is affecting infrastructure. For decades, farmers have relentlessly pumped groundwater to irrigate their crops, draining thick, water-bearing clay layers deep underground. As the clays compress, roads, bridges, and irrigation canals have cracked, causing extensive and expensive damage. \n- Addressing the groundwater deficit in the San Joaquin Valley could require taking at least half a million acres of farmland out of production. To prepare for this transition, the state this year budgeted $50 million for a land “repurposing” program, to help in converting farmland to other uses.\n- Large farms have planted vast expanses of almonds and pistachios to capitalize on rising global demand. And the unchecked pumping is affecting the wells small farmers rely on.Some have struggled to pay tens of thousands of dollars to fix failing wells, he said, “because their neighbor next door is very focused on maximizing their profit on their pistachio farm.”\n- . In the San Joaquin Valley, deep irrigation wells **lowered groundwater levels—already 250 meters below the surface** in places—putting it out of reach of shallower wells that provided thousands of people with drinking water. \n- Statewide surface reservoir storage capacity is approximately 52  billion  m3 (42 MAF), but total groundwater storage is approximately 500  billion  m3 (400 MAF), making groundwater the main stored water source for long droughts. Additional groundwater pumping supplied more than 70% of the drought reductions to agriculture’s water supply.\n\n\n### Prediction \n- Number of wells that are going to go dry (predict shortage)\n- Number of applications for wells\n- Rate of groundwater extraction\n- Identify areas where permeable geology is put into practice, (fields flodded or water pumped into ground)\n\n### The backdrop\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley—one of the richest agricultural regions in the world—is sinking. During a recent intense drought, from 2012 to 2016, parts of the valley sank as much as 60 centimeters per year\n\n\nCalifornia's [Sustainable Groundwater Management Act](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/gmp/) was passed in 2014 with the intension to address overpumping, halt chronic water-level declines and bring long-depleted aquifers into balance. California **depends** on groundwater for a major portion of its annual water supply, particularly during times of drought. This reliance on groundwater has resulted in overdraft and unsustainable groundwater usage in many of California’s basins.\n\nIn the meantime, a frenzy of well drilling has continued on large farms across the San Joaquin Valley, the state's largest and most lucrative agricultural zone. Growers have been pumping heavily during the drought, and groundwater levels have continued to drop. As a result, shallower wells supplying nearly a thousand family homes have gone dry this year. Families with dry taps have been left relying on plastic tanks and trucks that roll through the valley hauling water.\n\n### What can we learn and how it can be applied elsewhere\n\nWhen I visited Trivandrum, the capital of a top tourist destination state Kerala,in India that is suddenly booming and throving with activity after decades of slow and sleepy progress, it struck me that development had come with a huge cost.\n\n- The land around the house used to be loosened to allow for rain water seepage\n- Tar and concrete roads, even the brick lined lanes might not allow for as much percolation.\n- Result? Water has to be brought in by tankers to sustain the high rise and single home poulation\n\n- Groundwater science is taking on a new urgency as California and other regions around the world face growing threats from drought—and are increasingly drilling wells to make up for missing rain and snow. Globally, aquifers are \"highly stressed\" in 17 countries that hold one-quarter of the world's population, according to the World Resources Institute. Water and food supplies for billions of people are under threat.\n\n### Mitigation\n\n- Planting water-efficient crops helps—grapes and young almond trees use much less water than alfalfa, for example. So does leaving fields fallow, a strategy farmers have used to cope with past droughts.\n- Meanwhile, geologists are working to identify the best places to replenish aquifers by flooding farm fields, including some with especially permeable geology. \n- To slow the rate of depletion with less pain, a few districts are counting on proven methods for recharging aquifers. For decades, some water districts have filled dedicated ponds in wet years so that the water percolates into the ground. Others flood farm fields when water is plentiful. Vineyards can tolerate spring flooding, and some crops, like alfalfa, do well with flood irrigation. Building culverts and berms to move and hold the water can be expensive, however. In urban areas, where land is scarce or the upper layers of sediment or rock aren't very permeable, officials pump water into the ground instead of removing it.\n\n\n",
